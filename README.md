# Block puzzles

This page contains a Python script `blocks.py` for solving 2D and 3D 
block puzzles. An example of such a block puzzle is

## Features

* Solve puzzles using the Z3 solver.
* Save puzzles in SMT format.
* Draw puzzles and solutions in VRML format. A WRL viewer is required to view them. On Ubuntu, `view3dscene` can be used.

Below the pieces of the half-cube puzzle are shown.

## Puzzle format

A puzzle is stored in a simple textual format. Each line contains a
piece of the puzzle. A piece consists of the 3D coordinates of the cubes
of the piece. Hence, each line consists of triples of integer values.

The goal of a puzzle is stored in the same format as the puzzles. It should
contain one piece only, which is the desired configuration of the puzzle. 

The `puzzles` directory contains several examples of puzzles.
The `goals` directory contains target configurations of the puzzles.

If you have additional puzzles, please send them to [wieger@10x10.org](mailto:wieger@10x10.org),
so that I can add them to the repository. A puzzle consists of
a text file with the coordinates of the pieces, a text file with
the coordinates of the goal, a name of the puzzle, and optionally a
link to a description of the puzzle.

## Requirements

The Python package `z3-solver` must be installed, see https://pypi.org/project/z3-solver/.

## Using the script

The option `--draw` is used to create `.wrl` files that can be viewed
with a WRL viewer. The pieces of a puzzle can be drawn using a call like this:
```
python blocks.py --draw --pieces="puzzles/half_cube.txt" --grid
```
The option `--grid` puts the pieces in a 2-dimensional grid. This 
is done to avoid collisions.

The option `--scatter` is used to move pieces away from the center
of gravity. This can be helpful to view the inside of a solution, as
demonstrated in the picture below.

A solution of a puzzle can be drawn using a call like this:
```
python blocks.py --draw --pieces="solutions/offroad_cube-4x4x4.txt" --scatter=0.5
```

A puzzle can be solved using a call like this:
```
python blocks.py --solve --pieces="puzzles/offroad_cube.txt" --goal="goals/4x4x4.txt"
```
The input consists of a file containing the pieces of the puzzle, and a
file containing the goal of the puzzle. Note that some puzzles may take a long time to
solve.

The option `--transform` can be used to compute and display all possible
orientations of the pieces. For example the call
```
python blocks.py --transform --pieces="puzzles/hara_cube.txt" --goal="goals/4x4x4.txt"
```
results in the output
```
Saving 144 piece orientations to file 'hara_cube-0.wrl'
Saving 432 piece orientations to file 'hara_cube-1.wrl'
Saving 432 piece orientations to file 'hara_cube-2.wrl'
Saving 192 piece orientations to file 'hara_cube-3.wrl'
Saving 432 piece orientations to file 'hara_cube-4.wrl'
Saving 384 piece orientations to file 'hara_cube-5.wrl'
Saving 144 piece orientations to file 'hara_cube-6.wrl'
Saving 144 piece orientations to file 'hara_cube-7.wrl'
Saving 288 piece orientations to file 'hara_cube-8.wrl'
Saving 288 piece orientations to file 'hara_cube-9.wrl'
Saving 324 piece orientations to file 'hara_cube-10.wrl'
```
These numbers give an indication of how complex the puzzle is.

The option `--smt` is used to save the puzzle in `.smt` format. For
example the call
```
python blocks.py --smt --pieces="puzzles/offroad_cube.txt" --goal="goals/4x4x4.txt"
```
produces a file `offroad_cube-4x4x4.smt` that can be used as input for an
SMT solver.
